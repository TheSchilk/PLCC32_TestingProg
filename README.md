# PLCC_TestingProg
### Philipp Schilk

A board for programming/testing the SST39SF040 flash IC. 
It includes a PLCC32 Socket, breakouts of the Data, Address and Control Lines,
and optional shift registers to drive the address lines during programming.

Furthermore, if nothing but the PLCC32 socket is fitted, it may serve as a direct
breakout. 

Designed for the SST39SF040, but also usable with all other chips in the family
(F020, F010). Could be compatible with many other flash chips with similar layout.
